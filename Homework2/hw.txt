2. The first 12 (r,c) coordinates popped off the stack by the algorithm:
Stack:
6  4
6  3
6  5
7  5
8  5
8  6
8  7
8  8
7  8
6  6
5  4
4  4


4. The first 12 (r,c) coordinates popped from the queue in your queue-based algorithm:
Que:
6  4
5  4
6  5
6  3
4  4
6  6
7  5
3  4
4  5
8  5
2  4
4  6

Because using stack to traverse the maze is to apply DFS while using queue is to apply
BFS. DFS would try a path until no way to go each time but BFS will traverse its around points. This is why the visited cells in the maze are in a different order.
